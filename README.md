### ðŸ‘‹ About Me

I'm a passionate developer focused on building tools that improve lives. I am a 25-year-old programmer. I have reduced mobility due to a rare neurological disease, and I can only program for about half an hour a day. My commitment to creating impactful software remains constant despite these constraints.

I am currently dedicating my time to **PillPal**, a free medication reminder app designed to help users stay on top of their health and not miss a dose.
